# Button

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

To get started with buttons import a button:

```js
import Button from "@design-system/button"
```

The basic example of a button in this readme uses a button without any custom props set, but users can further customise their buttons.

```jsx
<Button>Button</Button>
```

Interactive playground examples are only added for code blocks with a `.jsx` prefix. Other code examples are rendered as simple code examples (see the import statement above).
