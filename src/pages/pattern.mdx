# This is a Sample App

You can make custom mockups of apps in the mockups folder and then view them using a `<Device />` frame.

You can view any mockup through a `<Device />`. Devices can show the mockup in portrait or landscape mode. Currently the mockups are accessible from the sidebar menu, but this is just to show what they look like raw.

<Device src="/patterns/sample-pattern" variant="mobile" />

This is what your app template looks like in landscape format.

<Device src="/patterns/sample-pattern" variant="desktop" />
