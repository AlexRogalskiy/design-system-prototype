# Introduction

This is just a simple Gatsby site powered by md and mdx pages. It can also generate some extra documentation sugar for your components.

<Image style={{ maxWidth: "300px", marginBottom: "1.45rem" }} />

Helper components for branding can be easily integrated into this system. There is full control over how to set up the sidebar and the design can be fully customised.

The documentation for each component is available on the website (with interactive code demos), and on github with simple code snippets. This is possible, because each package has a `readme.md`, which contains all of the docs. This way you can avoid writing docs twice.
