# Deisgn System Prototype

This repo contains a prototype of a react design system site. The docs are built using `gatsby-mdx` and `react-docgen`. The aim is to create the simplest experience for both component documentation, as well as overall branding docs and pattern showcase.

The component documentation exists both in the form of simple `readme.md` files on github and documentation pages using `react-live` for interactive playgrounds on the website.

### Getting started

To get started install the dependencies and run the dev server.

```
npm install
npm run develop
```
